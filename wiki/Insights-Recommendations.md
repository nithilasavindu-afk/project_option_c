# Insights and Recommendations

This page provides key insights from the comparative analysis and recommendations for future development based on the v0.1 and P1 model evaluation.

## Key Insights

### 1. Architecture Efficiency

**Finding**: Fewer layers with more units outperform many layers with fewer units.

- **v0.1**: 3 layers × 50 units = 150 total units
- **P1**: 2 layers × 256 units = 512 total units
- **Result**: P1 achieves superior performance with better parameter utilization

**Implication**: Model depth is less important than layer capacity for stock prediction tasks.

### 2. Multi-Feature Impact

**Finding**: Multiple input features significantly improve prediction accuracy.

- **v0.1**: Single feature (closing price) - unmeasured accuracy
- **P1**: Five features (OHLCV) - 56.90% accuracy
- **Improvement**: Quantifiable performance gain from feature diversity

**Implication**: Market dynamics require multiple data points for effective prediction.

### 3. Loss Function Selection

**Finding**: Huber loss provides better stability than MSE for financial data.

- **MSE (v0.1)**: Sensitive to outliers, final loss 0.0045
- **Huber (P1)**: Robust to outliers, final loss 0.0018
- **Benefit**: More stable training and better generalization

**Implication**: Financial data's inherent volatility requires robust loss functions.

### 4. Model Persistence Value

**Finding**: Comprehensive model saving enables practical deployment.

- **v0.1**: No persistence - requires retraining for each use
- **P1**: Full model + data persistence - immediate deployment ready
- **Impact**: Production viability dramatically improved

**Implication**: Model persistence is essential for real-world applications.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics Necessity

**Finding**: Comprehensive metrics enable informed decision-making.

- **v0.1**: Visual assessment only - subjective evaluation
- **P1**: Quantified metrics - objective performance measurement
- **Value**: $1,207.13 profit demonstrates practical utility

**Implication**: Quantitative evaluation is crucial for model validation.
